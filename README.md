# ExtendedCanvas
Extra drawing methods for the HTML5 Canvas 2d Context CanvasRenderingContext2D 
Meaning that after loading this library, your 2d context will inherit extra functions.

```javascript
var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
ctx.fillStar(50,150,10); //Fills a 5 sided star at X:50, Y:150, with a radius of 10.
```
